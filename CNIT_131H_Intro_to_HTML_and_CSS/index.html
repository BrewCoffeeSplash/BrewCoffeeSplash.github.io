      <h3>
        School Goals
      </h3>
      <p>
        I plan on getting a degree in web development. Either the front-end or back-end. Full-stack would most likely be later, but learning a bit over time. Part-time student while having a full-time job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplementing learning with other online classes and sources. I need to work on more actual projects to show to future employers. <br />And, not just a class assignment. It would need more back-end support such with SQL or NoSQL.
