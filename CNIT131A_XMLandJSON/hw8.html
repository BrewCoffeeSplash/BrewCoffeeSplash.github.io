            What is the main characteristic of XQuery?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It's similar to SQL or MongoDB in querying data but can also query data from multiple data sources. It's a expression-oriented programing language with a simple type system. It can be used to build and query web pages. It's best used for XML and object based databases. It's a W3C standard and widely supported by all major databases. It's easy to learn for anyone familiar with SQL compared to XSLT.(1,4)
                </li>
                <li>
                    An alternative would be XSLT. It's written in XML unlike XQuery. It was designed to process tree structures, which is best for retrieving results from them compared to XQuery. It is more powerful and sophisticated, but is harder to learn. XQuery is also faster than XSLT for huge amounts of data. (4,5)

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li name="test">
            Look at the XML in hw8.xml file (you will find this file in the CNIT131AFiles.zip folder you downloaded for this
            course). Look at the code in hw8.xq and based on your research, what is this code doing if applied on the XML of
            hw8.xml? Explain this example within your report
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The hw8.xq file will look into the XML file hw8.xml and goes to the book element of the root element bookstore. Under the price element of the book element, it then looks for any that have the price element that is less than 30. It returns the resulting title element for each book.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            What exactly is XQIB? How it can be used with XQuery?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    XQIB allows you to execute Xquery code like you would use Javascript. The library is quite small and easy to implement by including a script tag to the library. You can change and query the DOM, import modules, add event listeners, and make REST calls. The doc function is not supported. EXPath can be used to query other sources. (2,3)
