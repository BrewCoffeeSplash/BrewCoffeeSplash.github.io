</p>




<h2 id="mostimportant">Three Most Important Announcements!</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You <strong>must</strong> post an introduction in the "introductions" topic of the class forum by Monday, Feb 3, or I am required to drop you from the class. When you begin working your way through the modules, you'll see that this is the first task for week 1.
</p></li>

<li><p>Absolutely no assignments will be accepted for any reason after Wednesday, May 6.
</p></li>

</ul>


<h2>Am I in the Right Class?</h2>

<p>CS 110A is not a prerequisite for this class, but it (or an equivalent) is <strong>very</strong> highly recommended.  In this class we cover the 18 weeks of CS 110A material in 4 weeks (2 weeks during summer).  This class is not primarily intended for students with no programming experience.  You're welcome to give it a try, of course.  I just want to make sure you know what you are getting into.
</p>


<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>Our required text will be "Starting Out with C++: From Control Structures through Objects", 9th edition, ISBN 9780134498379.<br>
</p>



<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>Assignments are due at 11:59pm on the date indicated in this schedule.  Be sure to check the <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/index.shtml#latepolicy">late policy</a> for more information.

<h2 id="grading">Final Grades</h2>

<p>Your final score will be made up of the following components.</p>

<p class="filler"><img src="./CS 110B C++ Course Syllabus_files/4.jpg" alt="decorative pic of computer"></p>


<table>
<tbody><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td><strong>Points<br>Each</strong></td><td><strong>Points<br>Total</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignments (14)</td><td>50-55</td><td>730</td></tr>
<tr><td>Discussions (14)</td><td>5</td><td>70</td></tr>
<tr><td>Midterms (2)</td><td>50</td><td>100</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final</td><td>100</td><td>100</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>total</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>1000</strong></td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>Grades will be assigned as follows:  900 points for an "A", 800 for a "B", 700 for a "C", and 600 for a "D".  Grades of + or - are rare and at the instructor's discretion.</p>



<h2 id="assignmentsandprojects">Assignment Grades</h2>

<p>Do not use concepts in your assignments that have not been covered in class.</p>


<p>Programs must compile and run correctly under standard C++ (see the section on <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/index.shtml#compilers">Compilers</a> below for more information).  Any program submitted that does not work as specified in ways that are more than trivial will receive a score of 0.  Your scores on programs will be based only on issues of style and presentation.  In order to understand how to get a good score you must read the <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/index.shtml#style">Style Conventions</a> section of this document carefully.  You should also pay close attention to sample solutions that are given and instructions in the lessons and text.  Because of this emphasis on issues of style and presentation, students are often surprised at their low scores on programming exercises.  Be careful not to let this be you.  A working program may receive a failing score!
</p>


<p>
Programs will be scored according to the percentages in the following table.  Note that the number in the first column corresponds to the number in the <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/index.shtml#style">Style Conventions</a> section, which appears later in this document.

<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>

<p>There will be two midterms and a final.  All three rely heavily on the textbook reading assignments.  You may be tested on concepts that are not covered in the lessons or assignments.  All are taken online, and you can take each exam at any time of your choosing during day on which it is scheduled (see the <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/index.shtml#schedule">schedule</a>).  They are due at 11:59pm.  Once you start, each exam must be completed within one hour, without exception, so make sure to ensure that you will not be interrupted once you begin.  All exams are multiple choice.  The coverage of each exam is given in the schedule.  Of course, on midterm 2 and the final, you will need to know a few things from earlier in the course.
</p>


<p>You will take the exams on the honor code. The tests are available for an entire day for your convenience, but the validity of the tests relies heavily on your academic integrity. Don't take advantage of the flexibility by sharing questions with students who have not taken the test.
</p>

<p>You are required to simulate a class environment when you take the quizzes. The quizzes are open book and open notes and even open compiler, but you cannot receive any help from another person. The rules are summarized below. Email me if you have any questions:
</p>

<ul><li>Allowed: Textbook</li>
<li>Allowed: Notes</li>
<li>Allowed: Past assignments</li>
<li>Allowed: Compiling your answers</li>
<li>Not Allowed: Browsing non-class websites</li>
<li>Not Allowed: Accepting assistance from another person.</li>
<li>Not Allowed: Sharing questions with other students after the test.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="latepolicy">Late Policy</h2>

<p>This late policy is for assignments only.  Late exams are not accepted.
</p>

<p>Assignments are due at 11:59pm on the date indicated in the <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/index.shtml#schedule">schedule</a>.  Assignments must be turned in by the date listed in the course schedule.  However, assignments may be submitted up to 48 hours late with no penalty.  This is is the "final deadline".  This does not mean that the due date is extended!  For example, if your assignment is not done by the original due date, and you get severely ill between the due date and the final deadline, so that you cannot complete your assignment by the final deadline, it will be considered late.  In addition, failing to complete projects by the original due date will put you behind in the class, and may delay the grading of your assignment significantly.  You should make every effort to complete the assignment by the original due date.
</p>

<p>Beyond the final deadline, assignments will be accepted until 2 weeks after the original due-date (except that no assignments will be accepted after Wednesday, May 6).  They will be considered late and will receive a 50% deduction, with no exceptions.  Assignments are not accepted more than 2 weeks late.
</p>

<p>To repeat: absolutely no assignments will be accepted for any reason after Wednesday, May 6.
</p>
 

 
<h2 id="collaboration">Academic Dishonesty</h2>

<h3>Guiding Principal:</h3>
<p>It is imperative that every student master the topics covered in the course.</p>


<h3>Therefore:</h3>

<p>All work that you submit must be your own work.</p>

<p>You are free to work together with and get help from your classmates, and free to research topics online, provided that the work you submit is completely your own.  In this class, this will be measured as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Any such collaboration must be cited near the top of the documentation for your submitted code.</li>
<li>Any such collaboration must not result in code that is so similar to another student's code or to code found online that I am able to detect the collaboration.
</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand that point #2 may be hard for you to determine.  <strong>If you are not sure whether your collaboration crosses this line, PLEASE CHECK WITH ME</strong>.  Also, you will receive one warning.  There will be no consequence for a first violation of this policy, provided you have cited the collaboration.
</p>

<p>I suggest that in order to avoid any questions, you get all of the information you need for the course from the text and lessons.  If you need help, ask in the discussion, or get help from our class tutor.
</p>

<h3>Further guidelines for using online help:</h3>

<p>You should not use even one line of code that you find online, even if you modify it.  You may use websites for reference purposes (for example: how does a particular language feature work?).  But you should not get information specifically related to a problem you are trying to solve (for example: what's an algorithm for reducing a fraction?).  In particular, <strong>Don't ask for help from online forums</strong>.  They will almost invariably do the problem for you, or give you bad information.
</p>


<p>Examples of specific actions that violate this policy:</p>

<ul><li>Using chegg.com or coursehero.com for any reason</li>
<li>Using an online tutor</li>
<li>Viewing another student's code because you need help</li>
<li>Allowing another student to view your code because they need help</li>
<li>Viewing or copying code online that is specifically related to a course assignment</li>
</ul>




<h3>Consequences</h3>

<ul><li><p>A first violation of this policy (with no citation, as described above) will result in a zero on the assignment and the submission of an Academic Dishonesty Report.  
</p></li>

<li><p>If you have received a warning, then a subsequent violation of this policy will result in a zero on the assignment and the submission of an Academic Dishonesty Report, even if there is a citation.
</p></li>
 
<li><p>A subsequent violation following a violation that resulted in a zero on an assignment will result in an "F" in the class.
</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Student Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ul><li>Outcome 1: Create programs which use standard C++ language features, including functions, arrays, arrays of arrays, pointers, pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and structured data (structs).
</li>

<li>Outcome 2: Design and implement an abstract data type using a class with member variables, member functions, constructors, and a destructor.
</li>

<li>Outcome 3: Design and implement modular programs, created in appropriate .h and .cpp files, that use multiple classes with inheritance relationships, friend functions, friend classes, and operator overloading, using modern C++ language features and STL vectors and iterators where appropriate.
</li>
</ul>




<h2 id="compilers">Compilers:</h2>

<p>
You will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer.  This course requires that the assignments you turn in compile and run correctly with any ANSI/ISO standard C++ compiler.  You are free to use any C++ compiler you choose; however, I recommend Visual Studio if you are working in Windows and XCode if you are working on a Mac.  There are tutorials in the Week 1 Module in Canvas to help you get started with these.
</p>


<h2 id="style">Style Conventions</h2>
<h3>[How To Get Good Grades On Your Programs]</h3>

<p>In the real world, programmers usually work in teams and often the company that they work for has very precise rules for what kind of style to use when writing programs.  For this reason, and also to encourage good programming style, we will be adopting the following style conventions for this class.  This is not to say that these rules represent the only good style for writing computer programs (although in most cases they do).  After you finish this class, you may decide that you prefer a different style than what is required here.  However, in order to get good grades on your programming assignments in this class, you must follow these guidelines.
</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong>

<p><strong>Note: If the file is a class header file or a class implementation file, paragraphs A and C do not apply.
</strong></p>


<p>
<strong>A. Initial File Comment</strong>: Your programs should be well-documented.  Each program should begin with an initial file comment.  This comment should start by indicating your name, class, date, instructor, name of file, etc.  Next it should describe in detail what the program does and how the code works.  Any input expected from the user and any output produced by the program should be described in detail.  <strong>You should expect your initial file comment for the first few assignments to be at least 50 words, and later on in the course you should they will typically be about twice that.</strong>
</p>

<p>It's good practice to comment important or potentially confusing variables at their declaration, but I won't penalize you for omitting these comments.  Aside from this, in most cases it should not be necessary to place comments in the body of a function.  This usually clutters up your code and ends up making the function more difficult to read.  If you find yourself needing to explain something in the middle of a function, perhaps you should look for a clearer way to write it!
</p>

<p><strong>B. General Advice</strong>: Your comments should be directed toward a reader who is an expert C++ programmer.  You should not explain features of the language!

<p><strong>C. Function Comments</strong>: Just above each of your function definitions you must provide a comment describing what the function does.  <strong>A simple function might have a 15 word comment, while a more complex function might have a comment of at least 50 words.  Make sure to explain the role of each parameter in your function comments, and refer to them by name.</strong> Note: this paragraph does not apply to class member functions.
</p>

<p><strong>D.Comments in Classes</strong>: If this is your first time writing comments in a class, try your best to follow the instructions below, but don't worry too much about getting everything just right.  You'll get full credit if it looks like you gave it your best shot.
</p>

<p><strong>D.1. Header File</strong>: In the case of a class, the header file should begin with a (typically) very large header comment.  This comment should include a general description of the class (so a client programmer can tell right away whether she wants to use it), followed by a listing of all of the prototypes of public members, each with pre and post conditions.  Note that this list of prototypes is still part of the comment.  You will have to list the prototypes again in the code below this header comment!  <strong>You are required to use pre/post conditions to document your public member functions.</strong>  Do not include any comments regarding the implementation details in the header file!  This very large comment will then be followed by the header file code (e.g. the class declaration), with no comments.
</p>


<p>More info about pre/post conditions: <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/pre-post1.tiff">page 1</a> | <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/pre-post2.tiff">page 2</a></p>

<p><strong>D.2. Implementation File</strong>: In the implementation file you should start with a class invariant.  (I don't expect you to have prior knowledge of what a class invariant is.  The description that follows should suffice.)  The class invariant will include a description of the private data members and how they are used, as well as a statement of anything that you guarantee will always be true for class objects (for example:  "fraction objects will always be stored in lowest terms").  Aside from the class invariant, the only comments you will need in your implementation file are comments on the implementation of complex functions, and comments on private functions (which do not get comments in the header file).
</p>

<p>Here is an <a href="https://daveteaches.com/110b/class-comments-example.shtml">outline of how this will look</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Appearance:</strong>  

<p><strong>A. General</strong>: Use lots of whitespace (blank lines and spaces) to separate the different parts of your program!!  Put a blank line between your declarations and your statements.  Put a space before and after each operator so that instead of<br><br>


<span class="keyword">cout&lt;&lt;"Hello"&lt;&lt;x&lt;&lt;"my name is"&lt;&lt;endl&lt;&lt;bob;</span><br><br>


you write<br><br>

<span class="keyword">cout &lt;&lt; "Hello" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "my name is" &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; bob;</span>
</p>

<p>Make sure your lines aren't too long, no more than 80 or 90 characters.</p>



<p><strong>B. With Functions</strong>: <strong>Put at least 6 blank lines between function definitions.</strong>
</p>
</li>





<li>
<strong>Identifier Names:</strong>

<p><strong>A. General</strong>:  Choose your identifier names very carefully.  Variable names should precisely represent what the variable is storing. Do not use abbreviations unless you have seen the abbreviation used in a lesson.  Don't use one letter variable names except, perhaps, in for loops.
</p>


<p><strong>B. With Functions</strong>: Choose your function names so that as much as possible your program reads like English and the names describe precisely what the function does. Void function names should start with an action word  (readString, getData, etc.).  
</p>

</li>
<li>

<strong>Decomposition</strong>: <p>Any time there is a sequence of statements in your program that performs a specific, nameable sub-task, you should consider making that sequence of statements into a function.  A nice length for functions is about 10 lines, although they can be longer if they are simple (for example, lots of cout statements) or if there is just no logical way to break it up.  Consider making complex functions (for example, nested loops) even shorter.  A goal: when you are done with your program, I ought to be able to look at any particular function and have a general understanding of what it does and how just at a glance.
</p>

<p><strong>In this class you should rarely write a function longer than 10 lines.  There will be exceptions.</strong>
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Indentation</strong>:
<p>Indents must be exactly 4 spaces.</p>

<p>You may follow the indentation scheme used in the textbook or you may use the scheme used in the lectures.  No others.  For example, every statement must appear on a line by itself, every close curly brace must appear as the first (or only) item on a line, and every open curly brace must appear as the last (or only) item on a line.
</p>

</li>
<li><strong>Simple Code/No Repeated Code</strong>:
<p>Make sure that your code is as simple as possible and that there is no unnecessary repeated code.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Miscellaneous:</strong>

<ol class="sublist">
<li><p>[a2] In most cases no numbers other than 1 or 0 should appear in your program.  Other numbers should usually be declared as global constants.
</p></li>

<li> <p><strong>Do not use any global variables!!</strong> Violating this guideline will cost you a lot of points!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should follow the "single entry -- single exit" rule for functions and loops.  This means that you should not use a statement like "break" (except in a switch statement), "return" (except in a value-returning function), "exit", or "continue".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use pass by value unless you have a good reason to pass by reference.  Starting with a9: Use the "const" modifier when you are passing a parameter by reference but the value of the parameter should not be modified.
</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Don't mix up statements and expressions.  For example, count++ should not be used as an expression, but as a statement.

</p></li>

<li>
<p>You must use a value-returning function if (a) there is exactly one value being communicated to the calling function, and (b) there is no input or output occurring in the function.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a for loop for counter controlled loops.  Do not use a for loop for any other kind of loop.
</p>

</li><li><p>Never use the fact that C++ implements <span class="keyword">true</span> and <span class="keyword">false</span> using the <span class="keyword">int</span> values 1 and 0.  For example, never use 1 or 0 in the place of <span class="keyword">true</span> or <span class="keyword">false</span>.
</p>

</li><li><p>Use only standard C++.</p>

</li><li><p>Don't use <span class="keyword">typedef</span></p>


</li><li><p>Don't use <span class="keyword">goto</span>.</p>

</li><li><p>Don't use the ?: operator.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Don't use the preprocessor except for #include and for making sure that a header file is not multiply included (#define, #ifndef, and #endif).
</p>
</li>

<li><p>Use initializor lists only in derived class constructors.
</p></li>

<li><p>The characters "== true" or "== false" should never occur in your code.</p></li>
<li><p>You should never have</p>
<pre>if (x) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
</pre>
<p>in your code.  This can be replaced with simply</p>
<pre>return x;
</pre>
</li>

<li><p>Don't define member functions inside a class.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
