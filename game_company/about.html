        context of video games.

      <h3>What is Gold Mountain Games?</h3>
      <p>
        Gold Mountain Games is an amateur game-developing collective/incubator based in San
        Francisco, California that focuses on creating and distributing "hyper-local" games on various
        platforms.
      </p>
      <h3>Who can join Gold Mountain Games?</h3>
      <p>
        Game developers, software engineers, designers, artists, story tellers, historians; almost
        everyone has something that they can contribute to creating a hyper local game.
      </p>
      <h3>What is a "hyper-local" game?</h3>
      <p>
        A "hyper-local" game is any game that takes place in a "real-world" locality and tells stories
        about area. Our games tell stories about the people, places, and events that shape our local
        communities. While a "hyper-local" game can (and often will) include elements of fiction,
        science fiction, and fantasy; they are always rooted in real world locations.
      </p>
      <h3>Why create a "hyper-local" game?</h3>
      <p>
        For an amateur game developer, creating a game that takes place in their own community
        provides immediate inspiration and allows the developer to create a personal story. For the
        players; a "hyper-local" game can teach a local about things about their community that they
        never knew about, inform outsiders about communities and cultures that they would not
        otherwise be exposed to, and allow people who have had to leave their homes to "reconnect" to
        the places that they remember.
      </p>
      <h3>What do I get by joining Gold Mountain Games?</h3>
      <p>
        By joining Gold Mountain Games you gain access to our forums where you can connect with
        other game developers, artists, musicians, testers, and others with a similar vision to help bring
        your game to fruition. Once your game is completed, we can assist you in deploying it to our
        website or any other platform. In the future we hope to add tutorials for game development and
        licensing in hopes of allowing our community to thrive.
